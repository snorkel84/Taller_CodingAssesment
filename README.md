You have a model that is a car. You want to define its make, model, year, doors, colors, price. Build a simple service that contains some basic CRUD operations against a list of cars:

```
private List<Car> cars = new (){
        new Car { Id = 1, Make = "Audi", Model = "R8", Year = 2018, Doors = 2, Color = "Red", Price = 79995 },
        new Car { Id = 2, Make = “Tesla", Model = “3", Year = 2018, Doors = 4, Color = "Black", Price = 54995 },
        new Car { Id = 3, Make = "Porsche", Model = " 911 991", Year = 2020, Doors = 2, Color = "White", Price = 155000 },
        new Car { Id = 4, Make = "Mercedes-Benz", Model = "GLE 63S", Year = 2021, Doors = 5, Color = "Blue", Price = 83995 },
        new Car { Id = 5, Make = "BMW", Model = "X6 M", Year = 2020, Doors = 5, Color = "Silver", Price = 62995 },
    };
```

Build a simple page markup with where you display the car information and allow the user to guess the price. If within 5,000 of the guess, display a great job message in green.
